# Week 1
##Algorithm and recursion introduction

###1. Make an algorithm calculating the Fibonacci numbers Fn using recursion
Code can be found [here](https://github.com/Ebski/Algorithms/blob/master/Week%201/Fibonacci/Fibonacci/FibonacciRecursive.cs)

###2. Make an algorithm calculating the Fibonacci numbers Fn using an array
Code can be found [here](https://github.com/Ebski/Algorithms/blob/master/Week%201/Fibonacci/Fibonacci/FibonacciArray.cs)

###3. Compare the time of calculation for 1 and 2
The array is alot faster

###4. Make an algorithm calculating the ratio of Fibonacci numbers Fn+1/Fn
Code can be found [here](https://github.com/Ebski/Algorithms/blob/master/Week%201/Fibonacci/Fibonacci/FibonacciRatio.cs)

###5. Make an algorithm calculating the continued fraction
Code can be found [here](https://github.com/Ebski/Algorithms/blob/master/Week%201/Fibonacci/Fibonacci/ContinuedFraction.cs)

###6. Compare the results from 4 and 5
Given a high enough number both functions will go towards the number 1.618

###7. Make an algorithm calculating Square Root without using a library (like Math)
Code can be found [here](https://github.com/Ebski/Algorithms/blob/master/Week%201/Fibonacci/Fibonacci/SquareRoot.cs)

###8. Calculate (1 + SquareRoot(5)) / 2
The result is 1.618

###9. Calculate 1 + 2 * sin(PI/10) (OK to use Math here)
The result is 1.618

###10. Compare results from 4, 5, 8 and 9 with the golden ratio Ï•
All four results fit with the golden ratio
