# Week 2 - First Hand in
This reposotory includes the solutions for the first hand in excersize in Algorithms & Data structures.

###Birthday Problem
Write a program that takes an integer N from the command
line and uses StdRandom.uniform() to generate a random sequence of integers between
0 and N – 1. Run experiments to validate the hypothesis that the number of
integers generated before the first repeated value is found is ~√N/2.

The Birthday Problem solution can be found [here](https://github.com/Ebski/Algorithms/blob/master/Week%202/FirstStudyPointExcersize/FirstStudyPointExcersize/BirthdayProblem.cs)

###Coupon collector problem
Coupon collector problem. Generating random integers as in the previous exercise,
run experiments to validate the hypothesis that the number of integers generated
before all possible values are generated is ~N HN.

The Coupon Collector Prolem solution can be found [here](https://github.com/Ebski/Algorithms/blob/master/Week%202/FirstStudyPointExcersize/FirstStudyPointExcersize/CouponCollecterProblem.cs)
